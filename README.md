# BitForums

## Function
BitForums is an online discussion platform meant to foster long-form and high-quality discourse.
It's organized into a hierarchy:

Forum -> Conversation -> Post 

Forums are made up of conversations which are made of posts.

Individual conversations are navigated through the graph view.
Each node represents a post and the connections represent the replies to it.

This way, as conversations become more dense, individual topics can be easily distinguished and resolved without cluttering individual posts.

Additionally, the size of a post corresponds to the number of upvotes received.
Thus, the highest quality contributions are more visible, literally.
