# Rightly

## First Principles

The internet enables instantaneous and geography-blind communication
    - Anyone regardless of location, can engage in conversations with anyone else

Leading economists, academics, and politicians all engage in public speaking events,
demonstrating an interest in talking to the general public.
However, these leading thinkers aren't engaged in long-form written public discourse.
    - Why not?

Bad signal to noise ratio.
    - So much shit to sift through.
Lack of incentives.
These platforms are not designed to optimize for these kinds of discussions.
    - Many of these platforms aren't good at preserving posts past the immediately following time.
        - Try finding a specific twitter post that you didn't bookmark
        - Why would they spend time putting effort in, if they will have nothing to show for it
            - I remember reading in "Deep Work" that there was one professor who didn't write emails, 
            because he could spend it writing his book -- which do you want, a thousand sent/received emails or a book?

## How I've thought about structuring rightly

Bad signal to noise:
    Organize posts into conversations.
    Conversations are invite-only discussion forums that anyone can create.
    The point is for these to be high-quality written discussions are made up of individual posts.
    Posts can be standalone or replies to others. I'm thinking that a graph structure might be useful here.
    Incorporate some sort of upvote/downvote system. Posts with higher scores should have larger nodes in the graph model.
    (Not super high conviction on upvote/downvote system, but need to think about it more)
    Non-members can post, but they should be separated and not advertised. 
    I want non-members who make high-quality contributions to be considered for invitation.
    There should probably be some gradient of exclusivity on discussions, but I don't know if I need to develop anything for that.

Lack of incentives:
    Advertisements are probably going to be main source of income
    Some rev share will probably be determined by views/engagement(although, this could create perverse incentives)
    I think this is something that will only be determined by time. People who talk in public care about status.
    They want to be right. This gives them an opportunity to do so.

These platforms are not designed to be optimized for these kinds of discussions:
    The algorithms on most social medias are designed to give the content that will increase watch time/engagement
    Fundamentally, this goes against what this forum is meant to do.
    Through these conversations we want to seek truth, to find truth through argumenetation.
    That's what we are optimizing for.
    If someone said something incredibly profound on Twitter, you may never find it again.
    But when something gets enough upvotes/downvotes, it's gravity on the graph structure shouldn't diminsh with time
    I want to incorporate some amount of Gwern's idea of long-content
